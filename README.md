Tnex Blog Manager
=================

Running today on: [tnexblog.com](http://tnexblog.com)

Heavily inspired by: [LARBS Blog Script](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb)

I will not update here the usage, it is just an easy way to create blog posts
and (as of today) goals.

But it will be always updated in the script itself, just run `bm` and you will
get all functions and a short description.
